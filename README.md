# go-surf
 website for surfers

This site has several widgets. Used css animation. The jQuery library is connected. I use scripts to smoothly scroll the page, set up sliders using slick-slider, a calculator for calculating the cost of rest is implemented. Customized scroll bar. In this project, I also used preprocessors for html and css - pug / scss and task automation with gulp. Adaptation for mobile devices is not provided.
